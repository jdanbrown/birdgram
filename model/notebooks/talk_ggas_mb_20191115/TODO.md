# Speaker notes
- https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Speaker-Notes-MB-talk--AooUQ7ClIpk7cVW41dFwfolkAg-1bWoN68rRy6Mk0nNUIzDT

# Credits
- [x] add blanket xeno-canto credits on the title slide ("all recordings in this talk used from xeno-canto.org under CC license")
- [x] generate list/table of XC copyrights (for Credits slide at end)

# Alex
- [x] change words on each slide: just literally write my speaking notes (starting with "what do we see?")
- [x] bigger font in table on slide 2
  - say "clicking on" and "third recording"
- [x] bigger font in table headings on later 2-col slides
  - [x] omit / make fewer words on 2-col slides (and basically everywhere)
- [x] omit SOSP on how to spectro slide ("any time you say that's complicated, not adding value")

# General
- [x] make font way bigger (e.g. first 1-2 slides)
- [x] get rid of all banding codes
- [-] vertically center title slide
- [-] fix page offset in firefox (on too-big pages, some kind of centering)

# Outline
- [x] kill all visual sub-bullets, and don't explain them
- [x] talk for less time
- [x] i already know these things, i don't know a bunch of later things that i'd rather hear you discuss instead
  - "we all know song vary, i want to take you through my favorite way of understanding and learning bird sound,
    spectrograms (aka sonograms)."
  - "here's how to read one"
- [x] sketch of rewrite:
  - We learned from eddie's lecture various ways that bird songs vary
  - Spectrograms are an interesting way to understand them

# How to read a spectogram
- [x] trim to 5s
- [x] bigger font

# By gender (WREN) — [keep! intro to spectros] — [XXX added a dedicated intro to spectros]
- [x] keep the ~two bullets from BNA
  - male: accelerating
  - female: slower, more even rhythm
- [x] explain before playing
- [x] make the spectrogram REALLY BIG (only one spectro here)

# HUVI — [yay, this is about spectros!]
- [x] steady repetition of single note, ~1s apart, for minutes at a time
- [x] notes vary across separate vocalizations
- [x] show big table of spectros
- [x] ~15 spectros, as BIG AS POSSIBLE (keep as 10s)
- [x] explain sampling: random within HUVI

# Season: WIWA
- [x] cut SPTO (hard to see + we do it later)
- [x] only do WIWA (multiple examples not as interesting as geo next)
- [x] ~15 spectros, as BIG AS POSSIBLE, maybe crop to ~5s
- [x] explain sampling: Mar–Aug vs. Sep–Feb, random within groups
- [-] if spare time later, add counterexample of bird that sings all year

# Geo: SPTO
- [x] west coast vs. interior
- [x] fast/slow vs. slow only
- [x] no intro notes vs. intro notes
- [x] zoom to 10-15 rows (x2 cols), maybe crop to ~5s for taller
- [x] explain sampling: split west coast (~CA) vs. interior (~AZ/CO/MX), ignored stuff in the middle because lots of overlap

# All the wraa calls
- [x] tell don't quiz (esp interactive), present with labels
- [x] trim down to ~5 species i have found confusing in the field
  - e.g. BGGN has wiggly/polyphonic stuff vs. BEWR has none
  - e.g. HETH is more wheezy than SPTO
- [x] make spectros WAY BIGGER
- [-] "spectros to help clear up field confusion" better message than "here's a bunch of stuff you've never encountered in
      the field that looks similar as spectros"
