# TODO Mon, Thu

Alex
- [ ] change words on each slide: just literally write my speaking notes (starting with "what do we see?")
- [ ] bigger font in table on slide 2
  - say "clicking on" and "third recording"
- [ ] bigger font in table headings on later 2-col slides
  - [ ] omit / make fewer words on 2-col slides (and basically everywhere)
- [ ] how did you pick/sample the recs you're showing me
  - say immediate at LEGO example
- [ ] omit SOSP on how to spectro slide ("any time you say that's complicated, not adding value")
- [ ] play-button slide: describe what is the problem, not what everyone already knows they do and thinks is just fine
  - state problem
    - hold phone to your ear
    - you can only remember 1-2 at a time sound like
    - hard to compare different sounds because you forget
- [ ] LEGO slide #2
  - state solution
    - you can see all the sounds at once
    - what's the first thing you see? two different groups of sounds (jumbly finchy vs. whistles)
    - most whistles go down, some go up
- [ ] PSFL
  - what's the first thing we notice?
  - the same "stair-step" shape repeated many times
  - what does it sound like?
  - that's most of the sounds
- [ ] BEWR
  - what do we notice?
  - there are many different things
  - we know BEWR is hard
  - we can see why
  - (play a few)
  - we can easily see how variable it is, which is why we know we can't just learn one sound
- [ ] HUVI
  - what do we see?
  - we can see "johnny one note", with a different note every time

General
- [x] make font way bigger (e.g. first 1-2 slides)
- [x] get rid of all banding codes
- [ ] vertically center title slide
- [ ] fix page offset in firefox (on too-big pages, some kind of centering)

Credits
- [ ] add blanket xeno-canto credits on the title slide ("all recordings in this talk used from xeno-canto.org under CC license")
- [ ] generate list/table of XC copyrights (for Credits slide at end)

Outline
- [x] kill all visual sub-bullets, and don't explain them
- [ ] talk for less time
- [ ] i already know these things, i don't know a bunch of later things that i'd rather hear you discuss instead
  - "we all know song vary, i want to take you through my favorite way of understanding and learning bird sound,
    spectrograms (aka sonograms)."
  - "here's how to read one"
- [ ] sketch of rewrite:
  - We learned from eddie's lecture various ways that bird songs vary
  - Spectrograms are an interesting way to understand them

How to read a spectogram
- [x] trim to 5s
- [x] bigger font

By gender (WREN) — [keep! intro to spectros] — [XXX added a dedicated intro to spectros]
- [x] keep the ~two bullets from BNA
  - male: accelerating
  - female: slower, more even rhythm
- [-] explain before playing
- [-] make the spectrogram REALLY BIG (only one spectro here)

HUVI — [yay, this is about spectros!]
- [x] steady repetition of single note, ~1s apart, for minutes at a time
- [x] notes vary across separate vocalizations
- [x] show big table of spectros
- [x] ~15 spectros, as BIG AS POSSIBLE (keep as 10s)
- [x] explain sampling: random within HUVI

Season: WIWA
- [x] cut SPTO (hard to see + we do it later)
- [x] only do WIWA (multiple examples not as interesting as geo next)
- [x] ~15 spectros, as BIG AS POSSIBLE, maybe crop to ~5s
- [x] explain sampling: Mar–Aug vs. Sep–Feb, random within groups
- [ ] if spare time later, add counterexample of bird that sings all year

Geo: SPTO
- [x] west coast vs. interior
- [x] fast/slow vs. slow only
- [x] no intro notes vs. intro notes
- [x] zoom to 10-15 rows (x2 cols), maybe crop to ~5s for taller
- [x] explain sampling: split west coast (~CA) vs. interior (~AZ/CO/MX), ignored stuff in the middle because lots of overlap

All the wraa calls
- [x] tell don't quiz (esp interactive), present with labels
- [x] trim down to ~5 species i have found confusing in the field
  - e.g. BGGN has wiggly/polyphonic stuff vs. BEWR has none
  - e.g. HETH is more wheezy than SPTO
- [x] make spectros WAY BIGGER
- [ ] "spectros to help clear up field confusion" better message than "here's a bunch of stuff you've never encountered in
      the field that looks similar as spectros"
