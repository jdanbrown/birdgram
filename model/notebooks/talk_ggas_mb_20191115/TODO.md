# TODO Mon, Thu

General / Title
- [x] make font way bigger (e.g. first 1-2 slides)
- [ ] get rid of all banding codes

Outline
- [ ] talk for less time
- [x] kill all visual sub-bullets, and don't explain them
- [ ] i already know these things, i don't know a bunch of later things that i'd rather hear you discuss instead
  - "we all know song vary, i want to take you through my favorite way of understanding and learning bird sound,
    spectrograms (aka sonograms)."
  - "here's how to read one"
- [ ] sketch of rewrite:
  - We learned from eddie's lecture various ways that bird songs vary
  - Spectrograms are an interesting way to understand them

How to read a spectogram
- [ ] let's look at gender/WREN
By gender (WREN) — [keep! intro to spectros]
- [x] keep the ~two bullets from BNA
  - male: accelerating
  - female: slower, more even rhythm
- [ ] explain before playing
- [ ] make the spectrogram REALLY BIG (only one spectro here)

Age: RTHA
- [x] [skip? not about spectros]
- adult: scream (1 spectro)
- juv/imm: squeal (2 spectros)
- transitional parts (2 spectros)

Dawn/day
- [x] [skip? not about spectros]
- these spectros aren't even a great example of spectros being helpful ("not helping your point" — alex)

HUVI — [yay, this is about spectros!]
- [ ] steady repetition of single note, ~1s apart, for minutes at a time
- [ ] notes vary across separate vocalizations
- [ ] show big table of spectros
- [ ] ~15 spectros, as BIG AS POSSIBLE (keep as 10s)
- [ ] explain sampling: random within HUVI

Season
- [ ] cut SPTO (hard to see + we do it later)
- [ ] only do WIWA (multiple examples not as interesting as geo next)
- [ ] ~15 spectros, as BIG AS POSSIBLE, maybe crop to ~5s
- [ ] if spare time later, add counterexample of bird that sings all year
- [ ] explain sampling: Mar–Aug vs. Sep–Feb, random within groups

Geo: SPTO
- [ ] west coast vs. interior
- [ ] fast/slow vs. slow only
- [ ] no intro notes vs. intro notes
- [ ] zoom to 10-15 rows (x2 cols), maybe crop to ~5s for taller
- [ ] explain sampling: split west coast (~CA) vs. interior (~AZ/CO/MX), ignored stuff in the middle because lots of overlap

All the wraa calls
- [x] tell don't quiz (esp interactive), present with labels
- [ ] "spectros to help clear up field confusion" better message than "here's a bunch of stuff you've never encountered in
  the field that looks similar as spectros"
- [ ] trim down to ~5 species i have found confusing in the field
  - e.g. BGGN has wiggly/polyphonic stuff vs. BEWR has none
  - e.g. HETH is more wheezy than SPTO
- [ ] make spectros WAY BIGGER

Credits
- [ ] generate list/table of XC copyrights programmatically
