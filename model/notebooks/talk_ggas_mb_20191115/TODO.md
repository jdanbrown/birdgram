# TODO Mon, Thu

General / Title
- [x] make font way bigger (e.g. first 1-2 slides)
- [x] get rid of all banding codes

Outline
- [ ] talk for less time
- [x] kill all visual sub-bullets, and don't explain them
- [ ] i already know these things, i don't know a bunch of later things that i'd rather hear you discuss instead
  - "we all know song vary, i want to take you through my favorite way of understanding and learning bird sound,
    spectrograms (aka sonograms)."
  - "here's how to read one"
- [ ] sketch of rewrite:
  - We learned from eddie's lecture various ways that bird songs vary
  - Spectrograms are an interesting way to understand them

How to read a spectogram
- [x] trim to 5s
- [x] bigger font

By gender (WREN) — [keep! intro to spectros] — [XXX added a dedicated intro to spectros]
- [x] keep the ~two bullets from BNA
  - male: accelerating
  - female: slower, more even rhythm
- [-] explain before playing
- [-] make the spectrogram REALLY BIG (only one spectro here)

HUVI — [yay, this is about spectros!]
- [x] steady repetition of single note, ~1s apart, for minutes at a time
- [x] notes vary across separate vocalizations
- [x] show big table of spectros
- [x] ~15 spectros, as BIG AS POSSIBLE (keep as 10s)
- [x] explain sampling: random within HUVI

Season: WIWA
- [x] cut SPTO (hard to see + we do it later)
- [x] only do WIWA (multiple examples not as interesting as geo next)
- [x] ~15 spectros, as BIG AS POSSIBLE, maybe crop to ~5s
- [ ] if spare time later, add counterexample of bird that sings all year
- [x] explain sampling: Mar–Aug vs. Sep–Feb, random within groups

Geo: SPTO
- [x] west coast vs. interior
- [x] fast/slow vs. slow only
- [x] no intro notes vs. intro notes
- [x] zoom to 10-15 rows (x2 cols), maybe crop to ~5s for taller
- [x] explain sampling: split west coast (~CA) vs. interior (~AZ/CO/MX), ignored stuff in the middle because lots of overlap

All the wraa calls
- [x] tell don't quiz (esp interactive), present with labels
- [ ] "spectros to help clear up field confusion" better message than "here's a bunch of stuff you've never encountered in
      the field that looks similar as spectros"
- [x] trim down to ~5 species i have found confusing in the field
  - e.g. BGGN has wiggly/polyphonic stuff vs. BEWR has none
  - e.g. HETH is more wheezy than SPTO
- [x] make spectros WAY BIGGER

Credits
- [ ] generate list/table of XC copyrights (programmatically)
